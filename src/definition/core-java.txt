Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
Ans: They are building blocks of programs, scripts, commands, etc, in order to create software applications for computing devices to execute. 

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans: JDK, or Java Development Kit, is a set of development tools needed to run Java. It consists of JRE, the IDE (java), complier (javac), libraries
and operating systems, JVM and the operating system. 

What is IDE?
Ans: IDE is the Integrated Development Environment. This is a program like eclipse or intellij, which allow code to be run in proper syntax. 
These programs allow for auto-syntax to appear as well. For example, something like "public class Holiday {" will always auto appear when creating a class for
Java.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: Eclipse, IntelliJ, BlueJ, NetBeans, (Oracle) JDeveloper, DrJava. 

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans: 1- Editing the program. You can use a text editor such as Sublime Text, or even Notepad++. You write your code, then save it. 
2- Compile the source code. which then becomes javac. To do so, you make sure the file is saved with ".java" at the end of its name. 
3- Executing the byte code. It gets executed once the code is compiled, and it will be outputted by the JVM. 

what is class?
Ans: It is a template that describes the data and behavior associated with the instances of that class. It is used to create objects to do such instances. 

What is object?
Ans: Objects are modules that contain data and instructions. They are essentially the traits of a class.  

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: It is the main method, which is the start of the program. No matter where public static void main is in the program, Java will always output it first.

Why main is static?
Ans: It's due to the fact Java has to have a single main entry point for the JVM, otherwise it will produce an error. Java always needs it to be static,
so it can load with or without object creation. 

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Ans: Java.lang.Object is the superclass. It is the main class where other classes get information to and from. 

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Ans: Classpath is used in the JVM to determine the location of the required class files. Path is used to prodivde a path for other Java tools, like javac or javadoc.  

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?\
Ans: Abstract class hides internal features of an application and only shows the user the functionality aspects. Interface class is a collection of abstract methods 
that contain constants, default methods, static methods and nested types. 

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans: You cannot because they are incomplete classes. For abstract class, you implement a class (which is not abstract), and for interface class, you need a class
which will implement the bodies. Identifiers such as the "food" method can be used to achieve this. 

what is Access Specifier?
They regulate access to classes, fields, and methods in Java. The different types are:
Private- only accessible in that specific class
Default- no access specifier
Public- accessible and visible to everyone. 
Protected- accessible to that package and subclasses. 

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans: OOP (Object Oriented Programming) use objects in proframming. It's purpose is to bind together the data and functions that operate on them exclusive to that class. Features include:
Classes- blueprint for all objects 
Objects- contains variables (holds data) and methods (defines behaviors)
Abstraction- shows only relevant data to the user 
Encapsulation- binding object fields and methods together in a single class
Inheritance- one class inherits the properties of another class 
Polymorphism- object behaves differently in different situations. There is two types: method overloading and method overriding. 

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Ans: Packages group together related classes created within it. Java API has a build-in default one, java.lang, and it is automatically imported by javac. 

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans: API (application programming interface) defines interactions. Some that we have used so far are import, or packages. 

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Ans: It does not. Java language creators decided not to add it because it was too complex, and did nothing to benefit the program. 

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods in the same name. For example, int myMethod (int x). 

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans: Exceptions in java occur when an unwanted event occurs in the flow of the program, like errors in the code. One way to catch exceptions is to use the try/catch method to protect the code and create an exception for it to run. 

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans: Static is a constant that can be used to refer to the common property of all objects. It can be a variable, method, block, or nested class. It can be accessed at any time, and it's beneficial because it is memory efficient. 

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans: It is a non-access modifier used only for variables, methods and classes. They are used to create constant variables, prevents method overriding, and prevent inheritance. It is a constant, like static methods, and it cannot be modified once declared.  

What is final, finally and finalize?
What is a constructor ?

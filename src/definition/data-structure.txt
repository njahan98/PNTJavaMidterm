Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Data structures are used for efficiency for indexing. It allows for the process of data in the memory for efficient storage, access and processing. It's comprabale to a record system librarians use to log books. 

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
You can transverse, delete, update, search, merge, update and append data structures using operations. 

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler design, operating system, database management system, statistical analysis package, numerical analysis, graphics, artificial intelligence and simulation. 

what is an Array?
An array is used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of using individual variables for each value. 

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Arrays are basic functionalities, wheras ArrayList is a collection framework in Java. 

what is LinkedList?
It is part of the collection framework where elements are storied in separate objects. These objects have elements within the LinkedList method that allow them to have locations. It is very easy to add, change, remove, and iterate objects within this framework. 

How is an Array different from Linked List?
LinkedLists are preferred over arrays because of how maleable it is to add and delete objects. Linkedlists contain an ordered collection of the same element, wheras arrays are randomly accessed using an index. 

what is queue?
Queue is an interface of Java framework which provides the dunctionality of the queue data structure. It extends the collection interface. They are used in classes with Arrays, LinkedLists and PriorityQueues. 

what is stack?
It is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. It provides different operations, like push, pop, and search. It only defines the default constructor, which creates an empty stack. 

what is FIFO and LIFO?
First in first out and last in first out are used in stack. LIFO is when you add elements to the "top" of the stack, and remove elements from the top again. On the other hand, FIFO is when elements are added to the end of rhe queue, and removed from the beginning of the queue. 

what is the order of complexity?


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
